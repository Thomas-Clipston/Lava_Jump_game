Lava Jump game
--------------
This game is a 2d platformer, with each level having different mechanics.
ex.
- player controlling gravity
- controlling two characters at once
- lava coming up from the floor to kill you
- Menu screen/death screen
- custom desighned characters and assets.(some drawn by yours truly) 

Note: This game was uploaded with simplly the raw game maker files so if you wish to play it you have to download game maker on your device and run it on a project in that 
However I will be uploading to itch.io in the future so stay tune.
